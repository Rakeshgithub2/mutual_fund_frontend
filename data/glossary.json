        "correctAnswer": 3,
        "explanation": "Equity needs 5+ years (ideally 7-10 years) to deliver optimal returns. This timeframe smooths out market volatility and lets compounding work its magic. Historical data shows that the probability of loss in equity drops significantly when holding period exceeds 5 years."
